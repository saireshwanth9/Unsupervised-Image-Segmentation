# Unsupervised-Image-Segmentation
Implemented a research paper to train a system that classifies the labels of the image pixels into recognized categories.
Used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for unsupervised picture segmentation
Used Adam optimizer for getting better results than the procedure proposed in research paper.
The loss using 1000 iterations by implementing the paper is almost near to the loss when the Adam optimizer is used for 400 iterations.
